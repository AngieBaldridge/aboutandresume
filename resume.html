  <h3>Resume</h3>
  <p>I earned my MFA in painting at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia.
    I spent eight years teaching art in private art studios and public schools.
    Most of my teaching career was spent at the highschool level.
    I have facilitated the design and production of three murals and completed one on my own.
    I also exhibit my own art work and accept commission projects as time permits.
  <br>
    Recently I have ventured into the world of digital design, completing a UXDI immersive course,
    and taking graphic design and coding classes.</p>
