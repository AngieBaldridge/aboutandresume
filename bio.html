    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>I'm an artist and designer raised in the American Southwest. My background is in Fine Arts and education and I have always been fascinated by the human experience and how it is affected by beauty. Painting, drawing, and photography are a few of my hobbies. I like spice in my conversations and my cocktails.  </p>
